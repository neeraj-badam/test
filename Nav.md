Yes, at Liftoff I worked closely with DevOps, product managers, and QA engineers. For example, during the online bookstore project, I collaborated with DevOps to streamline CI/CD pipelines, with PMs to refine user flows, and with QA to resolve edge-case bugs before production.

one technical concept you recently learned or improved on?‚Äù

Recently, I dove deeper into Kubernetes and container orchestration while deploying microservices on Azure AKS. I learned about Helm charts, scaling policies, and how to monitor pods efficiently. It helped me understand production-grade deployment and infrastructure more clearly.

1. React

Question: ‚ÄúTell me about your experience using React in a real project.‚Äù

At Liftoff, I used React 18 to build the frontend for an online bookstore. One key feature I implemented was a real-time order tracking UI. I used React hooks like useEffect and useState to fetch order status updates via WebSockets and reflect them instantly in the UI. I also integrated Tailwind CSS for responsive design, which helped us quickly prototype components. This improved the user experience significantly and reduced customer complaints about delayed orders.

2. ASP.NET Core (C#)

Question: ‚ÄúCan you walk me through how you used ASP.NET Core in a backend system?‚Äù

I used ASP.NET Core at both Liftoff and DC Pvt Ltd to build RESTful APIs. At Liftoff, I created backend services for user authentication, payment processing, and order management. I used dependency injection and middleware for request validation and logging. One challenge was ensuring secure payment handling with Stripe‚Äîwe validated transactions server-side and logged them to PostgreSQL using EF Core. The APIs were tested with xUnit and deployed on Azure using AKS.

3. Azure DevOps & AKS (Kubernetes)

Question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your experience deploying applications to Azure using Kubernetes?‚Äù

At Liftoff, our team containerized backend services with Docker and deployed them to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). We created CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps to automate builds, run tests, and push Docker images to Azure Container Registry. For example, when we deployed the bookstore microservices, each one ran in its own pod, and we used Helm charts for consistent configuration. We also configured horizontal pod autoscaling to handle traffic spikes during monthly promotions.

4. PostgreSQL & Entity Framework Core

Question: ‚ÄúCan you explain how you used PostgreSQL and EF Core in your projects?‚Äù

At Liftoff, I used EF Core with PostgreSQL to manage user profiles, transactions, and order history. We had performance issues during checkout, so I optimized queries by adding proper indexing and avoiding unnecessary joins. For example, I rewrote a query fetching user order history using LINQ with eager loading instead of lazy loading, which cut the response time by 30%. I also handled schema migrations using EF Core tools in CI/CD.

5. OAuth2.0 / JWT Authentication

Question: ‚ÄúHave you implemented secure authentication in your apps?‚Äù

Yes. In the Liftoff bookstore project, I implemented OAuth2.0 and JWT for authentication and session management. Users could sign in via Google or create local accounts. On login, the server generated a JWT with claims for role-based access. The token was stored securely on the client and sent in headers for each request. Middleware validated tokens and roles before allowing access. This helped prevent unauthorized access and reduced security-related bugs.

6. Stripe / PayPal Integration

Question: ‚ÄúHow did you integrate payment systems like Stripe?‚Äù

In both Liftoff and DC Pvt Ltd, I integrated Stripe to process online payments. For Liftoff‚Äôs bookstore, I used the Stripe.NET SDK on the backend to create payment intents, and the React frontend handled the client-side checkout flow. I also implemented webhook handlers in ASP.NET Core to listen for events like payment_successful, updating the order status in the database. This setup handled over 200 monthly transactions securely and without manual intervention.

7. Twilio / SendGrid for Notifications

Question: ‚ÄúCan you explain your use of real-time notifications?‚Äù

At DC Pvt Ltd, we used Twilio for SMS reminders and SendGrid for email confirmations in our Smart Appointment System. I built a notification microservice that triggered messages when users booked or rescheduled appointments. For instance, after a Stripe payment, the backend would call the Twilio API to send a confirmation SMS, and SendGrid would send a calendar invite via email. This reduced no-shows by 60% and improved scheduling efficiency.

8. SailPoint IdentityNow (IDMS) & IAM

Question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your experience with identity and access management systems?‚Äù

At Deloitte, I worked on automating identity lifecycle management using SailPoint IDMS. I developed Java workflows to automate provisioning and de-provisioning of users across LDAP, Active Directory, and cloud apps. For example, when an employee joined or left, the workflow triggered automatic access updates within seconds, reducing manual work by 90%. We also used AWS Lambda for parts of the IAM system and Splunk for real-time alerting on access violations.

9. AWS Lambda & Step Functions

Question: ‚ÄúTell me about a serverless architecture you‚Äôve built.‚Äù

At Deloitte, I built a serverless access review system using AWS Lambda and Step Functions. When a user‚Äôs role changed in the HR system, a Step Function workflow triggered multiple Lambda functions to update their access in SailPoint, send review requests to managers, and store logs in S3. This fully automated what used to be a manual process and kept us in compliance with SOX and GDPR.

10. Testing with xUnit / Jest / Postman

Question: ‚ÄúHow do you ensure the quality of your code?‚Äù

I‚Äôm a strong believer in testing. At Liftoff, I wrote xUnit tests for backend services and used Jest for frontend components in React. I also automated API testing with Postman collections in CI. For example, when we integrated Stripe payments, I wrote test cases to verify successful charges, invalid cards, and duplicate transactions. This reduced production bugs by about 25% and gave the team more confidence during deployments.

11. JAVA Tell me about your experience with Java.

I used Java 17 extensively during my time at Deloitte to customize SailPoint IdentityNow workflows for identity and access management. One of the core projects involved automating user provisioning and de-provisioning across systems like Active Directory and LDAP.

I wrote custom Java beans and rule-based logic to handle onboarding, access reviews, and role-based access control. For instance, when a new employee was added in the HR system, our Java-based workflow would automatically trigger access provisioning across applications through RESTful APIs.

I also integrated these workflows with AWS Lambda and Step Functions for serverless execution. On the testing side, I used JUnit 5 to validate edge cases and ensure robust error handling. This automation reduced manual IAM efforts by over 90% and helped us stay compliant with SOX and GDPR.

Overall, Java was the backbone for all the core IAM logic and gave me hands-on experience in writing secure, scalable backend logic.

12.Java and Spring Boot

I worked with Java 17 and Spring Boot at Deloitte to build backend services for identity management. One of the main use cases was integrating with SailPoint and external systems like LDAP, Active Directory, and internal HR systems using secure RESTful APIs.

I used Spring Boot to expose endpoints that triggered workflows like user provisioning, access certification, and audit logging. For example, when a new user joined, a Spring Boot API would take the user data, validate it, and trigger downstream APIs and SailPoint workflows using HTTP clients.

I also used Spring Security to secure endpoints using OAuth2 and JWT tokens, and Spring Data JPA to manage our RDS data models. We containerized these services using Docker and deployed them via AWS Lambda or EC2 instances.

With JUnit 5 and Mockito, I wrote integration and unit tests, ensuring our services remained stable even as the IAM logic evolved. These services were part of a larger microservices architecture and integrated with cloud-native tools like Step Functions and S3.


### Spring Boot Concepts (with real examples)


1. Spring Boot Autoconfiguration

Spring Boot automatically configured our web and data layers‚Äîlike setting up default MVC and DataSource beans. For example, in our IAM microservice, I didn‚Äôt need to manually define the database connection or Tomcat server‚Äîit picked that up from application.properties and dependencies.

2. Spring Data JPA

I used Spring Data JPA to interact with PostgreSQL and RDS. We created entity models and repositories to manage user roles and access logs. For example, UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, String> gave us out-of-the-box CRUD operations, which we customized with JPQL for audit-specific queries.

3. REST Controllers (@RestController)

All APIs I developed used @RestController. For example, we had a /provision-user endpoint which received JSON input, passed it through validation and service layers, and triggered a workflow if access met business rules.

4. Spring Security + JWT

We used Spring Security with OAuth2 to protect our APIs. Once a user authenticated through our identity provider, they got a JWT, which was then validated by a Spring Security filter on every request. We also enforced role-based access by checking scopes in JWT claims.

5. Exception Handling (@ControllerAdvice)

To manage errors gracefully, we used a global exception handler with @ControllerAdvice. For example, if a user sent an invalid request or if the downstream SailPoint API failed, we returned consistent error responses like 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error.

6. Spring Scheduler / Async

For background IAM tasks like nightly audit checks or stale access cleanups, I used @Scheduled jobs. These jobs ran nightly to compare actual access vs assigned roles and raised alerts in case of mismatch.

7. Dependency Injection

We used Spring‚Äôs @Service and @Autowired annotations to inject services across layers. For example, the provisioning controller would inject AccessService, which in turn used RestClientService and UserRepository.

8. Spring Boot Profiles & Configs

We had multiple environments (dev, test, prod) and used Spring profiles (@Profile) with separate application-{env}.properties files for configs like DB URLs and credentials. This helped us avoid hardcoding and kept deployments clean.

**S:** At Deloitte, I worked with a colleague who consistently missed deadlines.

**T:** It impacted our IAM sprint deliveries, and I was leading a feature that depended on his task.

**A:** I set up a one-on-one to understand his blockers. It turned out he was new to the SailPoint API, so I helped him onboard and shared sample workflows. I also broke tasks into smaller chunks for clarity.

**R:** His productivity improved, and we completed the sprint on time. It taught me the value of proactive communication and support.

‚ÄúTell me about a time you received feedback.‚Äù

**S:** During my initial weeks at Liftoff, a senior engineer pointed out that my PRs had too many assumptions in business logic.

**T:** I needed to align more closely with product requirements and user cases.

**A:** I started reviewing tickets more thoroughly, asking questions early, and validating edge cases with QA and product before coding.

**R:** My code quality improved significantly and I began getting positive feedback in code reviews. It helped me mature as an engineer.

‚ÄúHow do you handle ambiguity?‚Äù

**S:** At DC Pvt Ltd, we were asked to build a booking calendar with vague requirements.

**T:** I needed to define how users would drag and reschedule appointments with minimal rework.

**A:** I met with the product owner, gathered feedback from support staff, and designed a prototype using Blazer. We validated it with users before scaling it out.

**R:** This reduced changes later in development and the calendar was one of the most appreciated features post-launch.

‚ÄúAre you open to remote roles or only in-office?‚Äù

I‚Äôm open to either. While I‚Äôd love the collaborative energy of an in-office team‚Äîespecially early in my career‚ÄîI‚Äôm also comfortable working in hybrid or remote setups. I‚Äôve worked with distributed teams at Deloitte and managed deadlines and code reviews effectively across time zones.

‚ÄúHow do you stay motivated during long or difficult projects?‚Äù

**S:** At DC Pvt Ltd, our Smart Appointment System project extended for 8+ months due to scope changes and customer requests.

**T:** I needed to stay focused while handling new feature demands and system issues simultaneously.

**A:** I broke my work into weekly goals, and whenever I felt stuck, I switched focus to small improvements like UX tweaks or performance tuning. Collaborating with teammates and seeing user feedback also kept me energized.

**R:** We delivered the project successfully, and I learned how to stay consistent, even when results aren‚Äôt immediately visible.

‚ÄúDescribe a time when you helped a teammate.‚Äù

**S:** At Liftoff, a new intern was struggling with our Stripe integration.

**T:** Since I had already built that module, I offered to help get them up to speed.

**A:** I walked them through our codebase, shared Postman collections, and helped them understand error logs. We pair-programmed the webhook logic so they could see it in action.

**R:** They became more confident and completed their feature ahead of schedule. It also helped build a stronger team dynamic.

‚ÄúHow do you handle disagreements in a team setting?‚Äù

**S:** During a sprint at Deloitte, we had a disagreement on how to handle access requests‚Äîone engineer preferred a manual workflow, while I advocated for automation.

**T:** I had to present my case without dismissing his concerns about control and auditing.

**A:** I proposed a hybrid model where critical roles required manual review while common roles were automated. I backed this with audit logs and test data.

**R:** The team accepted the solution, and we later found that automation covered over 80% of cases while preserving compliance. It taught me to find middle ground with facts, not opinion
