# Interview Readme

### 1. [Tell me about yourself](#tell-me-about-yourself)
I’m Neeraj Kumar, and I recently finished my Master’s in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte. I’ve been working as a Software Engineer, mostly focused on backend development using Java, Spring Boot, and databases like PostgreSQL.

I started my career at JP Morgan, then moved to MTX Group, and now I’m at Citi Bank, where I’m working on scalable systems and also contributing to CI/CD improvements using AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. I’ve also had the chance to work on the frontend with Next.js and TypeScript when needed.

I really enjoy working on clean, efficient systems and solving practical problems through code — which is why I’m excited about the opportunity at Amazon.

### 2. [Walk me through your resume](#walk-me-through-your-resume)

I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at Citi Bank, where I’m building backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, and also working with AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes to improve CI/CD and system scalability. I’ve also built frontend features using Next.js and TypeScript to improve user experience.

Before this, I was at MTX Group where I worked on a financial platform, focusing on both frontend and backend development. I used Next.js, Spring Boot, and integrated Redis caching to make the system faster and more efficient.

I started my career at JP Morgan, working on a mobile banking app where I contributed to API development, system security, and streamlined deployments using Azure DevOps.
